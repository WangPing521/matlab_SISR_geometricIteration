# matlab_SISR_geometricIteration

Tested on matlab R2017b

you can directly run the code in scale=2 or scale=3 for an image;

you can also revise the input and the output to run a dataset;

For scale=4, the code does not support the direct output, you need to get the x4 results by runing scale=2 two times;

MainFunction: Yc_main.m

The code is runnable, but is not optimized and also is not well-organized. We will optimize the code later.
